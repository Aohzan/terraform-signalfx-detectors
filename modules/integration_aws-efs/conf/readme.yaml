  We are using metrics from the
  [AWS/EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-metrics.html) namespace
notes: |
  ### Filtering based on aws_tag_env and aws_tag_sfx_monitored
  These values are not recovered from the AWS/EFS signalfx's modules at the moment.
  We have created a **FileSystemId** var to allow manual filtering. Default value: "*", you must change it to the wanted
  EFS Instance ID.
  ### Used space
  The **default EFS limit** (for space) is **8.0E**. Threshold for these detectors must be set based on customer's context.
  See CloudWatch to determine values.
  ### Read / Write IOPs
  Threshold for these detectors must be set based on customer's context. See CloudWatch to determine values.
